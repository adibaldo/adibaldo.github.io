## 2026-02-12 - Calendar Verification in Future-Dated Posts
**Learning:** When fact-checking religious calendars (e.g., Jewish Year), always calculate relative to the post's intended publication date, not the current date, to avoid flagging correct future dates as errors.
**Action:** Check frontmatter pubDate before verifying time-sensitive data.

## 2026-02-12 - Historical Metaphors vs. Facts
**Learning:** Authors may use vivid imagery (e.g., "camped on the beach") that is factually incorrect. Fact-checking should correct the mechanism (e.g., "requisitioned houses") while preserving the intended narrative impact (e.g., displacement/favelas).
**Action:** Identify the underlying historical event and replace inaccurate metaphors with descriptive facts that maintain the story's flow.
